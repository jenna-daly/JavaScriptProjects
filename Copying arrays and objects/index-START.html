    // let age2 = age;

    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    // console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    
    //team is a reference to players, goes back and updates everywhere which is not what we want

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[1] = 'Susan'
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[2] = 'Chris'

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'testing';
    // console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    
    console.log("Players " + players);
    console.log("Team 1 " + team);
    console.log("Team 2 " + team2);
    console.log("Team 3 " + team3);
    console.log("Team 4 " + team4);
    console.log("Team 5 " + team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    console.log("Person obj " + person);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    console.log("Cap 2 " + cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      name: 'wes',

      }
    };

    console.log("Wes with more than 1 level " + wes.social.twitter);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    //need deep clone to be able to change more than 1 level deep in copy only, like social info
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    console.log("Wes with deeper level change " +dev.social.twitter);
    //'poor man's' deep clone
